# Courses

Python code parses text file with course information into a json file.
Javascript code uses the course data to show things like:
- Requirments of a major, or requirments of multiple majors
- Courses left to complete
- Which course satisifies which requirments 
- How do maximise overlap minimise courses to take between majors
